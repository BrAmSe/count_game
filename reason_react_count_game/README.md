## About this

This is my first attempt of building a [Reasonml](https://reasonml.github.io/) application, also my first time with [ReasonReact](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/) and React functional components. To give the app this amazing look I used [PaperCss](https://www.getpapercss.com/). Feedback and comments about how to do things cleaner, better, faster, stronger are really appreciated

## Instructions

To play click the "start" button in the main window. Then select the options that sum the target value before the countdown finish. During the game, you can click the "reset" button to restart the game. Either if the countdown finishes or you get the right choice, a "Play again" button will appear to allow you to start a new game.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`
